# Linguistic Versus Data Properties for Swiss German ASR

This repository holds the code I used for my bachelor thesis.

## Kendall's Tau

The relevant scripts for calculating the Kendall's Tau and creating the heatmaps can be found in the directory
*kendall_tau*.

## Overview

An overview of all included systems and corpora in form of a .csv file can be found under *overview_table*. It could be
used as a starting point for future research. The directory further includes scripts used for calculating the measures
on the SwissDial corpus seen in the overview table. Measures for the ArchiMob corpus where extracted using single command
line commands and are therefore not included here.

## Spearman's Rank Correlation

The relevant scripts for calculating the Spearman's correlation can be found in the directory *spearman_correlation*.
